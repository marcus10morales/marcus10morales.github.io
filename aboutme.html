    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi my name is Marcus Lawrence. I am currently a sophomore here at the University of Rhode Island. I was born in Providence, Rhode Island. My ethic background is Afro-Latino, the Afro being Ghanian and the Latino being Colombian. I enjoy going to the gym, watching tv and movies, hanging out with friends and family, and helping people. I enjoy working in groups, however I do not mind working bymyself. </p>
